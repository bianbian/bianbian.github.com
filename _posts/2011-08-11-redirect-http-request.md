title: redirect http request

Environment: ubuntu-10.04.3-server, apache2

my domain config:

A Record: aws-&gt;ip

C NAME  : www-&gt;aws

have a site on apache2

by default, you can access the site through www, aws, ip. Since www is the domain I want to use, I want to disable the aws and ip way, or redirect them to www.

so I use NameVirtualHost and RedirectMatch to do that:

make www site a NameVirtualHost, add another NameVirtualHost and make it as primary server, redirect all request on this virtual host to www.

[sourcecode language="css"]
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
        # Redirect all requests other than known host to blog.bianbian.me
        RedirectMatch 301 (.*)$ http://blog.bianbian.me$1
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
[/sourcecode]
