One night during the examnation,I can't fall asleep.lots of things jump into my world.I think I'll wirte them out after the end of the examnation.It's the time now,but I couldn't know what I thought exactly that time.Mybe I'll forget them forever,or I don't eager to write them out,or they'll jump into my brain again in the future.

All maybe.
