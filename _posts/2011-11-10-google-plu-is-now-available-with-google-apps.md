As before, Google+ is not available for Google Apps users for there reasons, but not now!

Today I got email from Google(I'm using Google Apps email), which tell me "Google+ is ready for you!" :D

And I found the Official Announcement here: [Google+ is now available with Google Apps](http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-is-now-available-with-google.html).

Wahaha, Try and enjoy it!
