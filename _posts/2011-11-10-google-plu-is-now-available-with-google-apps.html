title: Google+ is now available with Google Apps
---
As before, Google+ is not available for Google Apps users for there reasons, but not now!
Today I got email from Google(I'm using Google Apps email), which tell me "Google+ is ready for you!" :D
And I found the Official Announcement here: <a title="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-is-now-available-with-google.html" href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-is-now-available-with-google.html" target="_blank">Google+ is now available with Google Apps</a>
Wahaha, Try and enjoy it!
